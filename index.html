		<h2><u>What is Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model?</u></h2>
		<h4>
			The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a <mark>conceptual framework that divides network communications functions into seven layers.</mark> Sending data over a network is complex because various hardware and software technologies must work cohesively across geographical and political boundaries.
		</h4>
		<hr>
		
		<h2><u>Why is the OSI model important?</u></h2>
		<p>
			The layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model encapsulate every type of network communication across both software and hardware components. The model was designed to allow two standalone systems to communicate via standardised interfaces or protocols based on the current layer of operation.
			<br>
			<br>
			The benefits of the OSI model are given below:
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>1)</strong> Shared understanding of complex systems.
			<br>
			<strong>2)</strong> Faster research and development.
			<br>
			<strong>3)</strong> Flexible standardization.

		<h2><u>What are the seven layers of the OSI model?</u></h2>
		<p>
			The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization and others
			in the late 1970s. It was published in its first form in 1984 as ISO 7498, <small><i>with the current version being ISO/IEC
			7498-1:1994.</small></i> 
			<br><br>
			<b>There are <del>six</del> <ins>seven</ins> layers of the OSI model. Those are given below:</b>
		</p>
		<h4><em>1.Physical layer</em></h4>
		<h4><em>2.Data link layer</em></h4>
		<h4><em>3.Network layer</em></h4>
		<h4><em>4.Transport layer</em></h4>
		<h4><em>5.Session layer</em></h4>
		<h4><em>6.Presentation layer</em></h4>
		<h4><em>7.Presentation layer</em></h4>
				
		<p>This <b><sup>Seven</sup></b> Layers of OSI Model are designed so that an application can communicate over a network with 
		another application on a different device, no matter the complexity of the application and underlying systems. <br>
		There is also another important model; <strong>The TCP/IP model</strong>. The TCP/IP model is comprised of 
		<b><sub>Five</sub></b> different layers.<br>
		<em><strong>The physical layer, The data link layer, The network layer, The transport layer and They application layer.
